                </center>
                <p> <br>Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans,the seeds of berries from
                    certain Coffea species.From the coffee fruit,the seeds are separated to produce a stable,raw
                    product:unroasted green coffee.
                    The seeds are then roasted, a process which transforms them into a consumable product: roasted
                    coffee, which is ground into fine particles that are typically steeped in hot water before being
                    filtered out, producing a cup of coffee.
                    <br>Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans,
                    primarily due to its caffeine content.[3] It is one of the most popular drinks in the world[4]
                    and can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caffè
                    latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). It is usually served hot, although chilled or iced
                    coffee is common. Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk or cream are often used to lessen the bitter
                    taste or enhance the flavor. It may be served with coffee cake or another sweet dessert, like
                    doughnuts.
